This is my final project.

I was going to spend some time creating an app that was perfectly centered for any screen size, but that isn't the point of this exercise, and I was spending too much time on it, so if you need to change the resolution to match your screen (I can\'t image why you would), in Main.java, lines 9 and 10:
```java
private static int screen_width = 1920;
private static int screen_height = 1080;
```
